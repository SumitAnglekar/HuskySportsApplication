# Husky Sports Management Portal
## WebTools Project

#### Why? ->  Being a graduate student, I realized grad student's are usually unaware about the ongoing team selections or openings for a particular sports team. They tend to miss out on trails or are total alien to the selection process.

#### What? -> One single portal for all the Huskies to apply for any sports team and have a fair trail based on their skills for that particular game. 

#### How? -> Management can post an opening, check who has applied and even message the candidate directly. Similarly, Huskies can apply to any number of available openings, reply to the management and plan their trails accordingly.
